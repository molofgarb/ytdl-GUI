# ytdl-GUI
A graphical user interface for the command line program, youtube-dl, written in Python 3, by molofgarb

## Notes
Currently, the text field for youtube URLs is populated with test videos as the program is still
in development. URLs should be separated by a space or line break.

## To-do:
- use the yt_dlp module provided by yt-dlp
    - maybe include support for youtube-dl again?
- allow the user to choose where to download the files
- allow user to choose format options
- help the user download youtube-dl if they don't already have
    - prioritize youtube-dlp
- show progress bar for download (label, or some kind of graphic)
    - prevent not responding window from happening
- make the readme
- put the G in GUI
- read the youtube-dlp doc and see if there is anything useful to also add, options
